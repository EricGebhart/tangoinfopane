=============

Nightingale / Songbird  extension for updating song metadata that shows Tango.Info, Todo Tango, and Wikipedia entries for selected songs.

This extension puts a browser window in the bottom pane of Nightingale which automatically loads the page for the selected orchestra from Tango.Info, Todo Tango, or Wikipedia.

When a product page on Tango.info is loaded the metadata from Tango.Info's track tagger is loaded and can be viewed in the 'view Tracks' mode. In this mode it is also possible to update the library metadata with the data from Tango.Info.

The matching is done purely by track number and disc number so it is very important to select the proper tracks to be updated in the library.
